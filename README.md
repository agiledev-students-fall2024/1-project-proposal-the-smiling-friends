# Project Proposal

We propose Task Destroyer, a mobile software to help high school and university students with poor time and task management to deal with their academic tasks efficiently. It will provide a simple yet powerful tool to organize homeworks, exams, and quizzes in one place. Many lower-level student struggle with balancing their workloads at the beginning of their new campus life, leading to stress and poor academic standing. Task Destroyer offers a solution that keeps everything organized, ensures that students stay on top of their tasks.

# For Whom?
Task Destroyer is designed primarily for high school and university students who need an intuitive platform to organize their academic schedules, especially for students who want to manage assignments, projects, and exams but also require reminders and task prioritization.

# How?
Students can input tasks such as homework and exams, assigning each task a deadline. Tasks can be categorized by subject or course, making it easier to stay organized. The application will send automatic reminders before a task’s deadline, with customizable notification times. Users can choose to receive reminders a day before, a few hours before, or even weekly updates for long-term projects. 

Also, user can set priority for tasks(like the exam might have higher priority), helping students focus on the most urgent deadlines first.


The software will also provide a simple progress tracker that allows students to mark tasks as different status(completed, not started, ongoing), offering visual feedback on their current progress. Then, a daily and weekly overview of all tasks and deadlines will be given, allowing students to see their workload at a glance.

For tasks that repeat regularly (like weekly quizzes or assignments for some courses), users can set up recurring tasks with automatic reminders, saving time and reducing the chance of forgetting.

Goal Setting: Allows students to set academic goals, such as finishing a project early or studying a set number of hours for an exam. This feature helps break down large tasks into manageable steps, ensuring they meet their academic goals.


# Scope
The core functionality focuses on task management, reminders, priority sorting, and progress tracker, which should be able to implement without requiring too complex algorithms or data structures. We will start with the basics—task input, reminders, and calendar views before expanding to include more advanced features like recurring tasks.
