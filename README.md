# Project Proposal

We propose developing a mobile application called StudyBuddy, aimed at helping students plan and manage their study schedules more efficiently. The app solves the problem of poor time management and inefficient study habits by providing personalized study plans, reminders, and learning resources tailored to individual needs. With academic stress on the rise, StudyBuddy will help users stay organized, improve their productivity, and ultimately enhance their academic performance.

For Whom?
StudyBuddy is designed for high school and college students who struggle with time management and balancing their academic workload. These users often face difficulties in maintaining a consistent study routine, especially during exam periods. Our initial target audience includes students in our own university and academic community, but the app is suitable for any student looking for a more organized study routine.

How?
From the end-user’s perspective, StudyBuddy will allow users to input their subjects, upcoming exams, and assignment deadlines. The app will generate a personalized study schedule, complete with reminders and suggested study techniques based on the type of content (e.g., flashcards for memorization, spaced repetition for retention). Users can track their progress, mark tasks as complete, and adjust their schedules as needed. Additionally, the app will provide access to curated study resources and tips on time management to help students optimize their study time.

Scope
This project is well-suited for a group of 4-6 developers and can be completed within the semester. The core features will include user authentication, study schedule generation, task tracking, and notifications. The complexity of the app is manageable, as we can begin with basic scheduling and reminder functionalities, then expand to include more advanced features like study techniques and progress tracking. The project’s scope strikes a balance between being technically challenging and achievable within the timeline, allowing room for future updates and improvements.
